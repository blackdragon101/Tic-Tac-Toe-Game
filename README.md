#  Tic Tac Toe Game (3D and 2D versions) üéÆ 

## Overview

This project implements a 3D & 2D Tic Tac Toe game using Python's Tkinter library. The game features a 3x3x3 (as well as single one) grid, offering a more complex twist
to the classic Tic Tac Toe. Players can play against each other on this 3D board, and the game determines the winner based on traditional Tic Tac Toe rules 
applied in three dimensions.

## Features

- **3D Grid** üî≥: A 3x3x3 grid representing three layers of 3x3 boards.(in 2D version, there is a single grid.)
- **Two Player Mode** ‚ùå‚≠ï: Play against another player with alternating turns.
- **Win Detection** üèÜ: Identifies winning combinations in all three dimensions.
- **Draw Detection** ü§ù: Alerts when the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Functionality** üìä: Restart the game to play again.
